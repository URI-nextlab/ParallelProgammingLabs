# Lab2_uart 

The design consists of a uart receiver receiving the input typed on a keyboard and displaying the binary equivalent of the typed character on the 4 LEDs. When a push botton is pressed, the lower and upper nibbles are swapped. The block diagram is as shown in the following figure.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/lab2.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Use the provided Xilinx Design Constraint (XDC) file to constrain the timing of the circuit.

* Elaborate on the design and understand the output.

* Analyze the output of the synthesized design.

* Change the synthesis settings and see their effects on the generated output.

* Write a checkpoint after the synthesis so the results can be analyzed after re-loading it.

## Source code

-[source code](https://github.com/Xilinx/xup_fpga_vivado_flow/tree/main/source/pynq-z2i/lab2)

## Steps

### Create a Vivado Project

* Same operations as Lab1.

### Add source files 

<div align=center><img src="imgs/2_1.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

### Add code

* Double-click on the *uart_led* entry to view its content. Notice in the Verilog code, the *BAUD_RATE* and *CLOCK_RATE* parameters are defined to be 115, 200 and 125M Hz. Also notice that the lower level modules are instantiated. The `meta_harden` modules are used to synchronize the asynchronous reset and push-button inputs.

* Expand `uart_rx_i0` instance to see its hierarchy. This module used the baud rate generator and a finite state machine. The `rxd_pin` is sampled at a x16 the baud rate.

* Because there are only 4 leds on PYNQ_Z2 board, so we need to fix the code in three files: `led_ctl.v`, `uart_led.v` and `uart_led_pins_pynq.xdc`.

* We don't need to add `uart_led_timing_pynq.xdc` file, it will lead to `setup timing problem`. Though its proposal is teaching us how to analyze it when we encounter this kind of problems, I think it is unnecessary here because there is no need to add timing constraints to LEDs. But if you want to learn it, please read the following document.

-[Document timing](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/ug949-vivado-design-methodology/Defining-Timing-Constraints-in-Four-Steps)

* Double click `led_ctl.v`.

```verilog

    input clk_rx,
    input rst_clk_rx,
    input btn_clk_rx,
    input [7: 0] rx_data,
    input rx_data_rdy,
    output reg [3: 0] led_o
);

    reg old_rx_data_rdy;
    reg [7: 0] char_data;
    reg [3: 0] led_pipeline_reg;

    always @(posedge clk_rx)
    begin

        end
        else
        begin
            old_rx_data_rdy <= rx_data_rdy;

            if (rx_data_rdy && !old_rx_data_rdy)
            begin
                char_data <= rx_data;
            end

            if (btn_clk_rx)
                led_pipeline_reg <= char_data[3: 0] ^ char_data[7: 4];
            else
                led_pipeline_reg <= char_data[3: 0];

### Elaborate the Design: Elaborate and perform the RTL analysis on the source file.  

* Expand the Open Elaborated Design entry under the RTL Analysis tasks of the Flow Navigator pane and click on Schematic. The model (design) will be elaborated and a logical view of the design is displayed.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/2_2.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

You will see four components at the top-level, 2 instances of meta_harden, one instance of uart_rx, and one instance of led_ctl.

* To see where the uart_rx_i0 gets generated, right-click on the uart_rx_i0 instance and select Go To Source and see that line 84 in the source code is generating it.

* Double-click on the uart_rx_i0 instance in the schematic diagram to see the underlying components.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/2_3.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

* Click on Report Noise under the Open Elaborated Design entry of the RTL Analysis tasks of the Flow Navigator pane. Click Ok to generate the report named `ssn_1`. View the `ssn_1` report and observe the unplaced ports. 

<div align=center><img src="imgs/2_4.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

### Synthesize the Design

#### Synthesize the design with the Vivado synthesis tool and analyze the Project Summary output.

* Click on Run Synthesis under the Synthesis tasks of the Flow Navigator pane.

The synthesis process will be run on the uart_led.v and all its hierarchical files. When the process is completed a Synthesis Completed dialog box with three options will be displayed.

* Select the Open Synthesized Design option and click OK as we want to look at the synthesis output. Click Yes to close the elabrated design if the dialog box is displayed.

* Select the Project Summary tab. If you donâ€™t see the Project Summary tab then select *Layout > Default Layout*.

* Click on the Table tab in the Project Summary tab.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/2_5.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

* Click on Schematic under the Open Synthesized Design tasks of Synthesis tasks of the Flow Navigator pane to view the synthesized design in a schematic view.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/2_6.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

Notice that IBUF and OBUF are automatically instantiated (added) to the design as the input and output are buffered. There are still four lower level modules instantiated.

* Double-click on the uart_rx_i0 instance in the schematic view to see the underlying instances.

* Select the uart_baud_gen_rx_i0 instance, right-click, and select Go To Source. Notice that the line instantiated uart_rx_i0 is highlighted. Also notice that the CLOCK_RATE and BAUD_RATE parameters are passed to the module being called.

* Go back to the schematic, double-click on the meta_harden_rxd_io instance to see how the synchronization circuit is implemented using two FFs. This synchronization is necessary to reduce the likelihood of metastability.

#### Generate the utilization and power reports

* Click Report Utilization under the Synthesized Design, and click OK to generate the utilization report.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/2_10.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

* Select Slice LUTs entry in the left pane and see the utilization by lower-level instances. You can expand the instances in the right pane to see the complete hierarchy utilization.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/2_11.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

* Click Report Power under the Synthesized Design, and click OK to generate the estimated power consumption report using default values. Note that this is just an estimate as no simulation run data was provided and no accurate activity rate, or environment information was entered. 

<div align=center><img src="imgs/2_12.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

#### Write the checkpoint in order to analyze the results without going through the actual synthesis process.

* Select *File > Checkpoint > Write* to save the processed design so it can be opened later for further analysis. A dialog box will appear showing the default name of the file in the current project directory.Click *OK*.

#### Change the synthesis settings to flatten the design. Re-synthesize the design and analyze the results.

* Click on the Settings under the Project Manager, and select Synthesis. Click on the flatten_hierarchy drop-down button and select full to flatten the design. Click OK. A Create New Run dialog box will appear asking you whether you want to create a new run since the settings have been changed.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/2_13.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

Change the name from synth_1_copy_1 to synth_flatten and click OK. Click Run Synthesis to synthesize the design. Click OK to open the synthesized design when synthesis process is completed. Click on Schematic under the Open Synthesized Design tasks of Synthesis tasks of the Flow Navigator pane to view the synthesized design in a schematic view. Notice that the design is completely flattened. Click on Report Utilization and observe that the hierarchical utilization is no longer available. Also note that the number of Slice Registers is 38.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/2_14.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

#### Write the checkpoint in order to analyze the results without going through the actual synthesis process.

Select File > Checkpoint > Write to save the processed design so it can be opened later for further analysis. A dialog box will appear showing the default name of the file in the current project directory.Click OK.

### Read the Checkpoints: Read the previously saved checkpoint (checkpoint_1) in order to analyze the results without going through the actual synthesis process.

* Launch Vivado and select *File > Checkpoint > Open ** at the *Getting Started Screen. Browse to {TUTORIAL}/lab2 and select uart_led.dcp or system_wrapper.dcp. Click OK.

* If the schematic isnâ€™t open by default, in the netlist tab, select the top-level instance, uart_led/system_wrapper, right-click and select Schematic. You will see the hierarchical blocks. You can double-click on any of the first-level block and see the underlying blocks. You can also select any lower-level block in the netlist tab, right-click and select Schematic to see the corresponding level design.

* In the netlist tab, select the top-level instance, uart_led, right-click and select Show Hierarchy. You will see how the blocks are hierarchically connected.

* Select Reports > Timing > Report Timing Summary and click OK to see the report you saw previously.

* Select Reports > Report Utilization and click OK to see the utilization report you saw previously.

* Select File > Open Checkpoint, browse to {TUTORIAL}/lab2 and select uart_led.dcp or system_wrapper.dcp.

* Click No to keep the Checkpoint_1 open. This will invoke second Vivado GUI.

* If the schematic isnâ€™t open by default, in the netlist tab, select the top-level instance, uart_led, right-click and select Schematic. You will see the flattened design. You can generate the desired reports on this checkpoint as you wish. Close the Vivado program by selecting File > Exit and click OK.

### Continues with the previous lab

#### Open a Vivado Project

1. Start the Vivado, if necessary, and open either the lab2 project (lab2.xpr) you created in the previous lab or the lab2 project in the labsolution directory using the Open Project link in the Getting Started page.

2. Select *File > Project > Save As â€¦* to open the Save Project As dialog box. Enter *lab3* as the project name. Make sure that the Create Project Subdirectory option is checked and click OK.

3. Click on the Settings in the Flow Navigator pane, select Project Settings > Synthesis.

4. Make sure that the flatten_hierarchy is set to rebuilt, which allows the design hierarchy to be preserved for synthesis, and then rebuilt which is more useful for design analysis because many logical references will be maintained.

5. Click OK.

A Create New Run dialog box will appear asking you if a new run should be created. Click Yes and then OK to create the new run with synth_2 name.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/2_26.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

### Implement the Design

* Click *Create Block Design* under *IP INTEGRATOR*. Click *+ (Add IP)* and search *zynq*, add *ZYNQ7 Processing Syatem* into the block design.

* In the `Sources` under *BlOCK DESIGN*, right click `uart_led` and choose *Add module to block design*.

* Back to *Diagram* window, add `axi uartlite` module.

* Right click and choose *Create port*. Set the port name to be *clk_pin_0*, set the *Type* as *Clock* and the *Frequency* as 125 MHz. And connect this port to `uart_led's clk_pin` and `ZYNQ7 Processing System's M_AXI_GP0_ACLK`.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/2_23.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

* The `rst_pin` of `uart_led` module is active high. So add `util_vector_logic` as a bridge that connect the `FCLK_RESET0_N` of `ZYNQ7 Processing System` and `rst_pin` of `uart_led` together.

Double click `util_vector_logic` and set the `C_SIZE` as 1 and select the *not* operation.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/2_24.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

* Expand `UART` in the `axi_uartlite` module, and connect `tx` to `rxd_pin` port of `uart_led` module. Connect `rx` to the `FCLK_RESET0_N` of `ZYNQ7 Processing System`.

* Click `Run Connection Automation` and `Run Block Automation`, remember that don't choose UART, then click *OK*.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/2_22.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

* The whole system diagram is shown in the following figure.

<div align=center><img src="imgs/2_25.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/></div>

* Following the left steps in the Lab1.


### Generate the Bitstream

* Click *Generate Bitstream* under *PROGRAM AND DEBUG*

### Verify the Functionality

1. Download the `.bit` file and `.hwh` file to your local PC. If you cannot find these two files, open a new terminal and go the project path, then run the shell command:

```bash
find . -name *.bit
find . -name *.hwh
```

2. Power *PYNQ* on

-[PYNQ code](https://github.com/parthpower/axi_uartlite_pynq/tree/master)

3. Following the similar step in the Lab1. Upload `.bit` and `.hwh`, make sure they are the same name. Copy `uartlite.py` from the upper github source to the folder. Here, we need to fix the `write function` to fit our project.

```python
def write(self, buf, timeout = 10):
        """
        buf: iterable
        
        """
        stop_time = time() + timeout
        wr_count = 0
        for i in buf:
            #Wait while TX FIFO is Full, stop waiting if timeout passes 
            while (self.uart.read(STAT_REG) & 1<<TX_FULL) and (time()<stop_time):
                pass
            # Check timeout
            if time()>stop_time:
                break
            self.uart.write(TX_FIFO, i)
            wr_count += 1
        return wr_count   
```

4. Create a new `Python3`.

```python
from pynq import MMIO
from pynq import Overlay

import sys
sys.path.insert(1, './src')
from uartlite import *

ol = Overlay("design_1_wrapper.bit")
ol.download()

# Address of the ip core
# Address can be found in the .hwh file 
ADDRESS = 0x42c00000           
uart = UartAXI(ADDRESS)

# Setup AXI UART register
uart.setupCtrlReg()

# Loopback test
l = [0xd3]
uart.write(l)
```

5. Then you can see the phenomenon that correspond to the input.
