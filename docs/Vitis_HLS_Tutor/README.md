# Preface

This open-source site is designed to support the educational needs of students, engineers, and enthusiasts in the fields of FPGA, SoC, and HLS. The content and lab exercises available here draw upon materials from several reputable sources with modifications, including workshops offered by AMD/Xilinx [link](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/university-program/workshops.html), the "Parallel Programming for FPGAs" course [link](https://pp4fpgas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) at UCSD, "Digital Computer Design" course [link](https://www.coursesidekick.com/electrical-engineering/2115253) at Clemson, and the "Parallel Programming on FPGAs" course [link](https://sharclab.ece.gatech.edu/teaching/2023-spring-fpga/) at Georgia Tech. Educators are encouraged to incorporate these resources into their curriculum.
